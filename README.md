## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Name:** Athens Concierge
**Type:** Commission-based booking platform
**Purpose:** Connects hotels with restaurants in Athens, Greece

### How It Works:
- Hotel concierges use the platform to book restaurants for their tourists
- Restaurants receive booking requests, confirm/reject, and mark as completed
- Hotels earn commission per completed booking
- Restaurants pay commission per completed booking
- Payments handled OFFLINE (cash/bank transfer) — platform only tracks data

### User Roles:
1. **Hotel** — Browse restaurants, make bookings, track earnings
2. **Restaurant** — Manage incoming requests, confirm/complete bookings
3. **Admin** — Oversee everything, view all bookings and restaurants
4. **Taxi** — Future feature

---

## 2. BUSINESS MODEL

### Commission Flow:
```
Tourist wants restaurant
       ↓
Hotel concierge books via platform
       ↓
Restaurant confirms booking
       ↓
Booking completed
       ↓
Restaurant pays commission
├── Hotel receives commission_hotel (e.g. €3)
└── Platform keeps commission_platform (e.g. €1)
```

### Key Business Rules:
- Commission is FLEXIBLE per restaurant (not fixed for all)
- Each restaurant has its own commission_hotel and commission_platform rates
- commission_earned is stored in each booking (snapshot at time of booking)
- Payments are offline — platform only tracks who owes what

---

## 3. TECH STACK

### Frontend:
- **React 19** — UI framework
- **Vite 7** — Build tool
- **React Router v7** — Client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS v3** — Styling (with custom design system via CSS variables)
- **Supabase JS v2** — Database client
- **lucide-react** — Icons

### Backend:
- **Supabase** — PostgreSQL database + Authentication
- Project URL: https://zpuppghpoyzdjgreiqke.supabase.co

### Tailwind v3 Setup:
- Requires `tailwind.config.js` with custom color system
- CSS variables defined in `index.css`
- PostCSS configured in `postcss.config.js`
- `@tailwindcss/vite` NOT used (v3 uses PostCSS instead)

### Design System:
Uses CSS variables mapped to Tailwind classes:
- `bg-background` — page background
- `bg-card` — white card background
- `bg-primary` — blue (#3b82f6)
- `bg-sidebar` — dark sidebar background
- `text-foreground` — primary text
- `text-muted-foreground` — secondary text
- `text-accent` — green (for earnings/success)
- `border-border` — border color

```

### RLS Policies:
```sql
-- restaurants: allow read
CREATE POLICY "allow read restaurants" ON restaurants FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- restaurant_bookings: allow read, insert, update
CREATE POLICY "allow read restaurant_bookings" ON restaurant_bookings FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "allow insert restaurant_bookings" ON restaurant_bookings FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "allow update restaurant_bookings" ON restaurant_bookings FOR UPDATE USING (true);

-- hotels: allow read
CREATE POLICY "allow read hotels" ON hotels FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

### Important Column Name Notes:
- restaurant_name (NOT name)
- price_range (NOT price)
- booking_date (NOT date)
- booking_time (NOT time)
- number_of_guests (NOT pax or guests)
- commission_earned (in bookings)

## 6. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE

```
Layout (shared by ALL dashboards)
├── DashboardLayout.jsx  — flex layout: sidebar + header + main
├── Sidebar.jsx          — accepts menuItems prop (flexible per role)
└── Header.jsx           — title, subtitle, stats pills

UI Components (shared by ALL dashboards)
├── StatusBadge.jsx  — colored pill for booking status
└── StatCard.jsx     — stat card with icon, label, value

Hotel Components
├── BookingsView.jsx     — filterable bookings table
├── RestaurantsView.jsx  — searchable restaurants table + Book Now
├── EarningsView.jsx     — stat cards + completed bookings table
└── BookingModal.jsx     — modal form to create a booking

Restaurant Components
└── IncomingBookingsView.jsx  — bookings table with Confirm/Complete/Reject

Admin Components
├── OverviewView.jsx          — platform stats + recent bookings
└── AdminRestaurantsView.jsx  — all restaurants table

Hooks
├── useDashboard.js      — manages activeView, persists in URL
├── useHotelData.js      — hotel bookings + restaurants from Supabase
├── useRestaurantData.js — restaurant bookings from Supabase
└── useAdminData.js      — all bookings + restaurants + hotels

Pages (brains — connect hooks + layout + views)
├── HotelDashboard.jsx
├── RestaurantDashboard.jsx
└── AdminDashboard.jsx
```

### Props Flow:
```
Dashboard (brain)
    → passes menuItems, stats, activeView to DashboardLayout
        → passes menuItems, stats to Sidebar
        → passes title, subtitle, stats to Header
        → renders view as children
            → view receives data as props
```

---

## 7. DESIGN SYSTEM

### Font: Inter (Google Fonts)

### Colors (CSS variables in index.css):
- Background: `hsl(210 20% 98%)` — very light blue-grey
- Card: `hsl(0 0% 100%)` — white
- Primary: `hsl(217 91% 60%)` — blue
- Accent: `hsl(160 84% 39%)` — green (earnings/success)
- Sidebar: `hsl(215 28% 17%)` — dark blue-grey
- Destructive: `hsl(0 84% 60%)` — red

### Border Radius:
- `rounded-xl` = 12px
- `rounded-2xl` = 16px (cards, modals)
- `rounded-full` = pill shape (badges, filter tabs)

---

## 8. CURRENT STATUS

### What's Working:
✅ Authentication (login/logout via Supabase)
✅ Role-based login redirect (hotel → /hotel, restaurant → /restaurant, admin → /admin)
✅ Protected routes
✅ Hotel dashboard — bookings, restaurants, earnings, booking form
✅ Restaurant dashboard — incoming bookings, confirm/complete/reject, earnings
✅ Admin dashboard — overview, all restaurants, earnings
✅ Real Supabase data (no mock data)
✅ Dynamic hotel_id (not hardcoded)
✅ Flexible sidebar (menuItems as prop)
✅ Booking form creates real bookings in Supabase
✅ Auto-refresh after booking created or status updated

### What's Not Started:
❌ Taxi dashboard
❌ Registration flow (hotels/restaurants sign up themselves)
❌ Better loading states (spinners)
❌ Real-time notifications (Supabase Realtime)
❌ Restaurant profiles (photos, menu, description)

---

## 9. USER ROLES & LOGIN

### Test Credentials:
- `test@hotel.com` / `test1234` → Hotel dashboard
- `test@restaurant.com` / `test1234` → Restaurant dashboard (Taverna Plaka)
- `test@admin.com` / `test1234` → Admin dashboard

### Role Detection Logic (LoginPage.jsx):
After login, check which table the user belongs to:
1. Found in `hotels` table → redirect to `/hotel`
2. Found in `restaurants` table → redirect to `/restaurant`
3. Neither → redirect to `/admin`

---

## 10. FUTURE FEATURES

### Registration Flow:
- Hotels sign up → creates auth user + hotels record
- Restaurants sign up → creates auth user + restaurants record

### Taxi Dashboard:
- Same pattern as restaurant dashboard
- `taxis` and `taxi_bookings` tables already exist in Supabase

### Real-time Notifications:
- Supabase Realtime — when booking status changes, notify hotel instantly

### Better Security (RLS):
- Hotels can only see their own bookings
- Restaurants can only see their own bookings
- Admin can see everything

### IDEAS / TO-DO

#### Per Hotel-Restaurant Commission Agreements:
Currently commission rates are set per restaurant and apply to ALL hotels equally.
A more advanced model would have a `hotel_restaurant_agreements` table:
```
hotel_restaurant_agreements
├── hotel_id
├── restaurant_id
├── commission_hotel    ← negotiated rate for THIS hotel only
└── commission_platform ← platform cut for THIS pair
```
This would allow:
- Different commission rates per hotel-restaurant pair
- Some restaurants to be hidden from certain hotels (no agreement = not visible)
- Restaurants that are too far from certain hotels to be excluded

#### Restaurant Availability per Hotel:
- Not all restaurants should be visible to all hotels
- A restaurant in Piraeus might not be relevant for a hotel in Kolonaki
- The `hotel_restaurant_agreements` table above would solve this
- Only restaurants with an agreement record would show in that hotel's list

## 11. DEVELOPER NOTES

### Running the Project:
```bash
cd /Users/giorgostsaloukidis/Desktop/hotel/frontend
npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:5173
```

### Environment Variables (.env):
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://zpuppghpoyzdjgreiqke.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### Git:
```bash
cd /Users/giorgostsaloukidis/Desktop/hotel
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push
```

### Supabase:
- Free tier pauses after 1 week inactivity
- Resume from Supabase dashboard
- Data is safe for 90 days after pause

### Adding a New Dashboard Role:
1. Create `hooks/useXxxData.js`
2. Create `components/xxx/` folder with views
3. Create `pages/xxx/XxxDashboard.jsx`
4. Add route in `App.jsx`
5. Add redirect in `LoginPage.jsx`

### Naming Conventions:
- Components: PascalCase `.jsx`
- Hooks: camelCase starting with `use` `.js`
- Utils: camelCase `.js`
